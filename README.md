## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I'm a newbie in this field and I'm not totally confortable with everything at the moment. I hope I'll get better in the near future !

I have some difficulties with images, they don't want to be placed how or where I want them. I also have this problem with grids.
I think it's because I have trouble knowing and understanding when to use vh/wh or % or px for the placement of certain elements.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Dev](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/) - Sometimes usefull and sometimes this confuses me even more. But it's a good tool overall
- [Open Classrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/forum/) - It's french, I don't know if it exists in other countries (if so, let me know !). The forum is great, I asked some questions one time and had help from two people
